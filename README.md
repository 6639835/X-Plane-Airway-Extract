## 📥 Installation

### Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.8 or higher
- 📦 pip package manager
- 📊 tqdm library for progress visualization

### Setup

1. Clone the repository (optional):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/6639835/X-Plane-Airway-Extract.git
   cd X-Plane-Airway-Extract
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tqdm
   ```

That's it! No complex configuration needed - you're ready to start converting airways!

## 🔧 Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Prepare your CSV file with the following columns:
   - `CODE_POINT_START` - Starting waypoint identifier (e.g., "EDDF")
   - `CODE_TYPE_START` - Starting waypoint type (e.g., "DESIGNATED_POINT", "VORDME", etc.)
   - `CODE_POINT_END` - Ending waypoint identifier (e.g., "EDDT")
   - `CODE_TYPE_END` - Ending waypoint type
   - `CODE_DIR` - Direction code (e.g., "N", "E", "W", "S", "X")
   - `TXT_DESIG` - Airway designator (e.g., "Q123")

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python X-Plane-Airway.py
   ```

3. Watch the magic happen! The script will:
   - Load reference data
   - Process your routes with a slick progress bar
   - Generate a perfectly formatted X-Plane DAT file

### Advanced Configuration

Customize the script by modifying these path variables:

```python
csv_file = '/path/to/your/RTE_SEG.csv'               # Your input CSV file
earth_fix_path = '/path/to/your/earth_fix.dat'       # Earth fix reference file
earth_nav_path = '/path/to/your/earth_nav.dat'       # Earth nav reference file
earth_awy_path = '/path/to/your/earth_awy.dat'       # Earth airways file to update
```

**Pro Tip**: The reference dat files can be found in your X-Plane installation directory, typically under `/X-Plane 12/Custom Data/` or `/X-Plane 11/Custom Data/`.

### Region Filtering

The tool can automatically filter out airways from specific regions. By default, it filters out airways within Chinese airspace:

```python
# Define excluded areas (Chinese airspace)
china_areas = {'ZB', 'ZG', 'ZY', 'ZS', 'ZW', 'ZJ', 'ZP', 'ZL', 'ZH', 'ZU'}
```

You can customize this set to include or exclude different regions as needed.

## 📊 Data Formats

### Input CSV Format

Your CSV should contain these columns (order matters!):

```
CODE_POINT_START,CODE_TYPE_START,CODE_POINT_END,CODE_TYPE_END,CODE_DIR,TXT_DESIG
EDDF,DESIGNATED_POINT,EDDT,DESIGNATED_POINT,N,Q123
EDDT,DESIGNATED_POINT,EDDH,DESIGNATED_POINT,N,Q123
```

### Output DAT Format

The generated DAT file follows X-Plane's exact specifications:

```
I
1100 Version - data cycle 2504, build 20250429, metadata AwyXP1100. Copyright (c) 2024 Justin

EDDF DT 11 EDDT DT 11 N 1  0 600 Q123
EDDT DT 11 EDDH DT 11 N 1  0 600 Q123
99
```

### Reference DAT Files

The tool needs these X-Plane reference files:
- `earth_fix.dat` - Contains fix points and their area codes
- `earth_nav.dat` - Contains navigation aids and their area codes
- `earth_awy.dat` - The destination file for updated airways

## 📝 Examples

### Basic Conversion Example

```bash
# Assuming files are in their default locations
python X-Plane-Airway.py

# Console output:
# 2025-04-29 10:15:23 - INFO - Filtering airways from /path/to/earth_awy.dat...
# Filtering Airways: 100%|██████████| 45280/45280 [00:05<00:00, 8562.50it/s]

```

### Custom Paths Example

```python
# Modify these lines in the script:
csv_file = '/Users/pilot/Documents/navdata/my_airways.csv'
earth_fix_path = '/Applications/X-Plane 12/Custom Data/earth_fix.dat'
earth_nav_path = '/Applications/X-Plane 12/Custom Data/earth_nav.dat'
earth_awy_path = '/Applications/X-Plane 12/Custom Data/earth_awy.dat'
```

## ❓ FAQ

### How do I find the area codes for my waypoints?
You don't need to! That's the beauty of this tool - it automatically extracts the area codes from X-Plane's navigation data files.

### Can I convert multiple CSV files at once?
Currently, the tool processes one CSV file at a time. For multiple files, you would need to run the script multiple times with different input/output paths.

### What if some waypoints don't have area codes?
The tool will log warnings about missing area codes and skip those route segments. Check your CSV for typos or verify that the waypoints exist in your X-Plane navigation data.

### Can I use this with older X-Plane versions?
Yes! The tool is compatible with X-Plane 11 and 12, as long as you have the appropriate reference files.

### How does the region filtering work?
The tool checks the area codes of both endpoints of each airway. If both endpoints are in the filtered regions (e.g., Chinese airspace), the airway is removed from the output.

### What is X-Plane Extract Supplement.py?
This is a companion script that provides additional functionality for extracting and processing X-Plane navigation data. It works alongside the main X-Plane Airway.py script. The Supplement offers a more streamlined process that can directly modify your earth_awy.dat file in a single operation - filtering out airways from specified regions (like Chinese airspace) and adding new routes from your CSV data. This provides an easier workflow for users who want to update their navigation data without creating intermediate files.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "File Not Found" Errors
- Double-check all file paths in the script
- Verify that the files actually exist at those locations
- Make sure you have read/write permissions for those directories

#### "KeyError in CSV" Errors
- Ensure your CSV headers exactly match the required column names
- Check for hidden characters or spaces in your CSV headers
- Verify that your CSV is properly formatted (try opening it in a text editor)

#### "Missing Area Codes" Warnings
- Check for typos in waypoint identifiers
- Verify that the waypoints exist in your X-Plane navigation data
- Make sure you're using the correct reference files for your region

#### Performance Issues
- For very large CSV files, ensure your computer has sufficient memory
- Close other memory-intensive applications while running the script
- If processing is slow, consider splitting your CSV into smaller files
