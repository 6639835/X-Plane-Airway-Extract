Get ready for takeoff!  Installing the Alchemist is quicker than your pre-flight checklist:

### Pre-Flight Checklist -  Just the Essentials 📋

- **Python Powerhouse Engine:** 🐍 Python 3.8 or higher - Ensure your Python engine is purring like a Rolls-Royce Merlin! 💨

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/6639835/X-Plane-Airway-Extract.git
    cd X-Plane-Airway-Extract
    ```
    Grab the source code and prepare for customization (if you're into that!).
2.  **Inject the `tqdm` Boost -  Fueling the Progress Bar Engine:**
    ```bash
    pip install tqdm
    ```

## <a id="usage---master-the-magic-in-minutes"></a> 🗺️ Usage -  Master the Magic in Minutes 🧙‍♀️

Unleashing the Alchemist's power is surprisingly simple.  You'll be converting CSVs like a pro in no time!

### Basic Incantations -  Commands You'll Actually Remember! 📜

To perform your CSV-to-DAT alchemy, just make sure `X-Plane-Airway-Extract.py` and its data companions (`earth_fix.dat`, `earth_nav.dat`, and `RTE_SEG.csv`) are hanging out in the same folder, or point the script to them with the correct paths.

1.  **Prepare Your CSV Masterpiece (`RTE_SEG.csv`):** 🎨  Make sure your CSV is structured with the right headers – think of them as magic words: `CODE_POINT_START`, `CODE_TYPE_START`, `CODE_POINT_END`, `CODE_TYPE_END`, `CODE_DIR`, `TXT_DESIG`.  Check the script's code for the *exact* spell (header names).
2.  **Invoke the Alchemist! -  Let the Transmutation Begin!** 🔥
    ```bash
    python X-Plane-Airway-Extract.py
    ```
    BOOM! 💥  Magic happens.

    **Default Settings -  Plug and Play Awesomeness!:** 🕹️

    - Input CSV Masterpiece: `RTE_SEG.csv`
    - Earth Fix Grimoire (Area Code Source #1): `earth_fix.dat`
    - Earth Nav Compendium (Area Code Source #2): `earth_nav.dat`
    - Output DAT File of Pure Flight Path Gold: `output.dat`

    These paths are pre-configured for maximum convenience.  Want to use different files?  No problem! Just tweak the script's internal settings (modify these variable assignments within the Python script):

    ```python
    csv_file = '/path/to/your/my_awesome_airways.csv'  # Example:  Customize your CSV filename!
    earth_fix_path = '/path/to/your/earth_fix.dat' # Point to your earth_fix.dat location
    earth_nav_path = '/path/to/your/earth_nav.dat' # Point to your earth_nav.dat location
    output_file = '/path/to/your/epic_airways.dat' #  Customize your output DAT filename!
    ```

    **Important Navdata Intel -  Source of the Area Code Magic!:** 🕵️‍♀️  `earth_fix.dat` and `earth_nav.dat` *must* be genuine X-Plane navdata files – the real deal, typically found deep within your X-Plane installation's navdata vault 🏰 (e.g., `X-Plane 12/Resources/default navdata/`).  These are the **keys to the area code kingdom!** 🔑

### CSV Format Demystified -  Headers You Need to Know! ✍️

The Alchemist expects a CSV structured like a pro, with these columns, in this specific order, and with these *exact* header names (case-sensitive, like a secret code!):

-   `CODE_POINT_START`
-   `CODE_TYPE_START` (Whispers of: `DESIGNATED_POINT`, `VORDME`, and other mystical waypoint types)
-   `CODE_POINT_END`
-   `CODE_TYPE_END` (More whispers of: `DESIGNATED_POINT`, `VORDME`, and their mystical brethren)
-   `CODE_DIR` (Directions like `N`, `E`, `W`, `S`, `X` - your airway compass headings)
-   `TXT_DESIG` (The airway's secret code name, for those in the know)

Dive into the script's code for the ultimate understanding of how these columns fuel the transmutation process. 🤓

## <a id="data-formats---decoding-the-matrix-of-navdata"></a> 📜 Data Formats -  Decoding the Matrix (of Navdata) 💻

The Alchemist speaks fluent data in these formats:

-   **.csv (Input CSV Awesomeness):** 🌟 Your starting point – a Comma Separated Values file, packed with your route segment data.  Structure it right, and magic awaits!  *Think of it as raw potential, ready to be unlocked.*
-   **.dat (Output DAT Nirvana):** ✨ The glorious result – an X-Plane DAT navigation data file, purpose-built for route segments. *This is the flight path gold you've been seeking!* 💰
-   **.dat (Lookup Navdata Powerhouses: earth_fix.dat, earth_nav.dat):** 📚 The wisdom sources – Authentic X-Plane navdata files, consulted to infuse your creations with the vital area code magic.  Untouched and pure, these are the data dictionaries of the skies. 📖

## <a id="troubleshooting---no-pilot-left-behind"></a> ⚠️ Troubleshooting -  No Pilot Left Behind! 🚑

### Common Turbulence & How to Navigate Through It 🌪️

-   **"File Not Found!" - System Meltdown Alert!** 🚨 Double-check that `RTE_SEG.csv`, `earth_fix.dat`, and `earth_nav.dat` are exactly where the script expects them, or that you've carefully updated the paths in the script's settings.  *File paths are like flight paths – precision is key!* 📍
-   **"KeyError in CSV!" - Header Hijack!** 🏴‍☠️ Your CSV headers might not *perfectly* match the Alchemist's sacred header names (`CODE_POINT_START`, `CODE_TYPE_START`, etc.).  Double-check your CSV header row with laser focus. 🔍 *Headers are like runway lights – they need to be aligned!* 💡
-   **"Warning: No area code found..." -  Area Code MIA!**  लापता 🕵️ The Alchemist couldn't find an area code in `earth_fix.dat` or `earth_nav.dat` for a waypoint in your CSV.  This could be due to waypoint typos or mysteries hidden within your navdata files.  Review the whispered waypoint names and confirm their existence in your navdata data banks. 🕵️‍♀️ *Waypoints are like landmarks – they need to be on the map!* 🗺️
