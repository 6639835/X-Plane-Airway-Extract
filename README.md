## üì• Installation

### Requirements

- üêç Python 3.8 or higher
- üì¶ pip package manager
- üìä tqdm library for progress visualization

### Setup

1. Clone the repository (optional):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/6639835/X-Plane-Airway-Extract.git
   cd X-Plane-Airway-Extract
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tqdm
   ```

That's it! No complex configuration needed - you're ready to start converting airways!

## üîß Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Prepare your CSV file with the following columns:
   - `CODE_POINT_START` - Starting waypoint identifier (e.g., "EDDF")
   - `CODE_TYPE_START` - Starting waypoint type (e.g., "DESIGNATED_POINT", "VORDME", etc.)
   - `CODE_POINT_END` - Ending waypoint identifier (e.g., "EDDT")
   - `CODE_TYPE_END` - Ending waypoint type
   - `CODE_DIR` - Direction code (e.g., "N", "E", "W", "S", "X")
   - `TXT_DESIG` - Airway designator (e.g., "Q123")

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python X-Plane-Airway.py
   ```

3. Watch the magic happen! The script will:
   - Load reference data
   - Process your routes with a slick progress bar
   - Generate a perfectly formatted X-Plane DAT file

### Advanced Configuration

Customize the script by modifying these path variables:

```python
csv_file = '/path/to/your/RTE_SEG.csv'               # Your input CSV file
earth_fix_path = '/path/to/your/earth_fix.dat'       # Earth fix reference file
earth_nav_path = '/path/to/your/earth_nav.dat'       # Earth nav reference file
output_file = '/path/to/your/output.dat'             # Where to save the result
```

**Pro Tip**: The `earth_fix.dat` and `earth_nav.dat` files can be found in your X-Plane installation directory, typically under `/X-Plane 12/Custom Data/` or `/X-Plane 11/Custom Data/`.

## üìä Data Formats

### Input CSV Format

Your CSV should contain these columns (order matters!):

```
CODE_POINT_START,CODE_TYPE_START,CODE_POINT_END,CODE_TYPE_END,CODE_DIR,TXT_DESIG
EDDF,DESIGNATED_POINT,EDDT,DESIGNATED_POINT,N,Q123
EDDT,DESIGNATED_POINT,EDDH,DESIGNATED_POINT,N,Q123
```

### Output DAT Format

The generated DAT file follows X-Plane's exact specifications:

```
I
1100 Version - data cycle 2504, build 20250429, metadata AwyXP1100. Copyright (c) 2024 Justin

EDDF DT 11 EDDT DT 11 N 1  0 600 Q123
EDDT DT 11 EDDH DT 11 N 1  0 600 Q123
99
```

### Reference DAT Files

The tool needs these X-Plane reference files:
- `earth_fix.dat` - Contains fix points and their area codes
- `earth_nav.dat` - Contains navigation aids and their area codes

## üìù Examples

### Basic Conversion Example

```bash
# Assuming files are in their default locations
python X-Plane-Airway.py

# Console output:
# 2025-04-29 10:15:23 - INFO - Loaded 80171 fix points and 4907 nav points
# Processing Rows: 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 5280/5280 [00:08<00:00, 632.50it/s]
# 2025-04-29 10:15:32 - INFO - Processing completed! Wrote 10558 lines to /path/to/output.dat
```

### Custom Paths Example

```python
# Modify these lines in the script:
csv_file = '/Users/pilot/Documents/navdata/my_airways.csv'
earth_fix_path = '/Applications/X-Plane 12/Custom Data/earth_fix.dat'
earth_nav_path = '/Applications/X-Plane 12/Custom Data/earth_nav.dat'
output_file = '/Users/pilot/Documents/navdata/custom_airways.dat'
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

### How do I find the area codes for my waypoints?
You don't need to! That's the beauty of this tool - it automatically extracts the area codes from X-Plane's navigation data files.

### Can I convert multiple CSV files at once?
Currently, the tool processes one CSV file at a time. For multiple files, you would need to run the script multiple times with different input/output paths.

### What if some waypoints don't have area codes?
The tool will log warnings about missing area codes and skip those route segments. Check your CSV for typos or verify that the waypoints exist in your X-Plane navigation data.

### Can I use this with older X-Plane versions?
Yes! The tool is compatible with X-Plane 11 and 12, as long as you have the appropriate `earth_fix.dat` and `earth_nav.dat` files.

### How large a CSV file can I process?
The tool has been tested with CSV files containing over 10,000 route segments. Processing time depends on your computer's specifications, but it's typically very fast.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "File Not Found" Errors
- Double-check all file paths in the script
- Verify that the files actually exist at those locations
- Make sure you have read/write permissions for those directories

#### "KeyError in CSV" Errors
- Ensure your CSV headers exactly match the required column names
- Check for hidden characters or spaces in your CSV headers
- Verify that your CSV is properly formatted (try opening it in a text editor)

#### "Missing Area Codes" Warnings
- Check for typos in waypoint identifiers
- Verify that the waypoints exist in your X-Plane navigation data
- Make sure you're using the correct `earth_fix.dat` and `earth_nav.dat` files for your region

#### Performance Issues
- For very large CSV files, ensure your computer has sufficient memory
- Close other memory-intensive applications while running the script
- If processing is slow, consider splitting your CSV into smaller files
